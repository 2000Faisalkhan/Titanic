# Titanic
I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. I performed data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. Using machine learning techniques, I built a predictive model that accurately predicted survival. This project improved my data analysis and modeling skills while uncovering factors affecting survival.
